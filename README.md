# Simple 2D Physics Engine in Java

This application is a custom two-dimensional physics engine that simulates rigid-body physics
in a virtual environment. A user can add or delete two different types of shapes: squares 
and circles.
The physics engine will handle the collisions, force, and momentum of the objects. 

The target audience of this custom two-dimensional physics engine is simply anyone 
who wants to see the effects of virtualizing real-world physics into a computer-based render and
who wants to interact with said environment. However, this is mainly for my benefit. I
realize there are already physics engines of industry standard out there, but I believe that
coding my own will deepen my understanding regarding implementing numerical methods,
the laws of physics, and computer graphics into a program. As such, it will be a useful
exercise in programming and problem-solving.
